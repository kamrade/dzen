      position: 'Product Designer (Software Designer)',
      location: 'OpenPayd (Sofia, Bulgaria)',
      aboutCompany: 'The company offers financial services for businesses, including global payment processing, open banking, card transactions, and various other services from the fintech world. I helped build the Compliance Center app to make it easier for clients to join us, to add new features and perform corporate review. I worked on the Transactions Monitoring tool, which keeps our payments secure and helps spot any illegal activity quickly.',
      myParticipation: `Using React MUI as the foundation, we crafted a design system that harmonized seamlessly with the company's branding. The application was split into two segments: client-facing and back-office, allowing for the reuse of a suite of system components across various user scenarios. I outlined user stories and test cases, which served as the blueprint for creating end-to-end tests. Additionally, I played a hands-on role in detailing development tasks. During my time here, I accumulated extensive experience in developing systems with evolving requirements. Nearly every release introduced a new list of requests, often conflicting with previous ones. Eventually, agreements were reached, leading to faster and more efficient development. We established a flexible architecture that was less prone to changes, optimized all interfaces between backend and frontend, and implemented test scenarios. As a result, the system became more resilient to future changes.`,
